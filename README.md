# My dotfiles

## Vim stuff

You need Packer and Neovim >=5.0:

Node for CoC, or just install nvm which is already configured in my .zshrc file

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash`

## Zsh

I use oh my zsh and powerline 10k, you need nerdfonts:

<https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts>

`curl -L git.io/antigen > .antigen.zsh`

## Tmux

Install tmux plugin manager, the theme is the one provided by oh my tmux

<https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm>

## Alacritty

It's almost the default config, just with a one dark pro theme

## Gow

go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
